# Product Overview

Gemini CLI Spec-Driven Development is a framework that implements Kiro-style specification-driven development workflows within the Gemini CLI.

## Core Features

- **3-Phase Approval Workflow**: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation with mandatory human review at each phase.
- **Intelligent Steering System**: Automated creation and maintenance of project knowledge documents (product, tech, structure).
- **Command Toolset**: A suite of commands for managing the complete spec-driven development lifecycle.
- **AI-Powered Generation**: Leverages Gemini to generate documents for requirements, design, and tasks.
- **Project Template System**: Ready-to-use structure for quick project setup.

## Target Use Case

This framework is designed for software development teams and individual developers who want to:

- **Maintain consistency** across AI-assisted development sessions.
- **Ensure quality** through structured review processes.
- **Track progress** transparently on complex feature development.
- **Preserve project knowledge** through persistent steering documents.
- **Follow systematic development** rather than ad-hoc coding approaches.
- **Integrate AI assistance** into established development workflows.

The system is particularly valuable for:
- Complex feature development requiring multiple development sessions.
- Team environments where project knowledge needs to be shared.
- Long-term projects where architectural decisions need documentation.
- Quality-focused development requiring structured review processes.

## Key Value Proposition

**Bridging the gap between Kiro IDE's advanced spec-driven development and Gemini CLI's powerful AI assistance.** 

The framework provides:
- **Structured AI Collaboration**: Transforms ad-hoc AI interactions into systematic development processes.
- **Knowledge Persistence**: Maintains project context across sessions through steering documents.
- **Quality Assurance**: Enforces human review at critical development phases.
- **Automation with Control**: Automates routine tasks while preserving human oversight.
- **Proven Methodology**: Implements battle-tested Kiro development patterns in the Gemini CLI environment.

This enables developers to achieve the same level of systematic, high-quality development that Kiro users enjoy, while leveraging Gemini CLI's accessibility and powerful AI capabilities.
